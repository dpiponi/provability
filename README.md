# Provability

This is a small library for working with Provability Logic.

It can:

1. Check a proposition is a theorem
2. Apply Craig's interpolation lemma to interpolate between two propositions
3. Apply the Beth definability theorem to convert an implicit definition into an explicit one
4. Find fixed points

More details soon but the library is fully functional and comes with Haddock documentation.
